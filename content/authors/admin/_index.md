I’m a research assistant and Ph.D. student advised by Professor Jay Taneja. I’m interested in the implementation of intelligent systems and IoT applications that use machine learning techniques to build more efficient and reliable energy systems. My research aims to develop computing tools in the context of emerging economies that create similar features to smart electricity grids with less fixed infrastructure but a heavier use of data and algorithms.
